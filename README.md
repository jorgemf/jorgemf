# Deep Learning Researcher & Engineer

As a dedicated Deep Learning Researcher and Engineer, my passion for Artificial Intelligence has driven my academic and professional pursuits. Graduating with first-class honors in Computer Science Engineering in 2006, I have continued to expand my knowledge and expertise in the field by obtaining a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and an MBA. Currently, I am further enhancing my skill set by pursuing a degree in Mathematics.

Having collaborated with innovative startups in San Francisco, London, and Madrid, I have thrived in remote roles since 2015, adapting to diverse work environments and embracing cutting-edge technologies. My relentless commitment to learning and process improvement is at the core of my work methodology. By staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in Deep Learning and diligently automating repetitive tasks, I aim to streamline processes and deliver exceptional results.

I am eager to bring my drive for excellence and continuous improvement to my next professional opportunity, contributing to the growth and success of a forward-thinking organization.

I am currently working as a remote freelance for Deep Learning related projects, mostly of them for people who want to create a startup. These are fun projects where I am applying most recent research in order to create cutting edge prototypes.
