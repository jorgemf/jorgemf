# Deep Learning Researcher & Engineer

I have been working with Artificial Intelligence since I discovered it in the year 2000. In the last years, I have been working as a remote Deep Learning Researcher & Engineer for different startups of San Francisco, London and Madrid. I have even founded a startup with 2 colleagues where we did consultancy projects in Artificial Intelligence. I have an MBA and I have also pursued a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence before. I was graduated with first-class honors and I have been awarded several by the research and work done, both locally and internationally. I love maths since I was very young and I have been a finalist in a couple of international math contests I joined in as a hobby.

I am currently working as a remote freelance for Deep Learning related projects, mostly of them for people who want to create a startup. These are fun projects where I am applying most recent research in order to create cutting edge prototypes.
